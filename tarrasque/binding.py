    A generator that iterates through the demo's ticks and updates the

    The start parameter defines the tick to iterate from, and if not set,

    The end parameter defines the point to stop iterating; if not set,
    the iteration will continue until the end of the replay.

    the tick; the default of one means that every tick will be yielded. Do

    always be larger than the step, but usually not equal to it.
